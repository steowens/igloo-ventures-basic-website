## Does Your Business Lose Customers Because They Can't Reach You?

I tried calling GCI the other day with a simple question about static IP pricing. Within minutes, I was bounced through authentication questions, told I needed a different account type, and was about to get transferred to another department. I hung up. They lost the sale - not because I didn't want their service, but because getting a simple answer was too much work.

### Here's what I'm building:

Custom AI chat systems that handle your customers' basic questions 24/7 - pricing, hours, services, availability. When someone hits your website at 6am or 9pm with a question, they get an instant answer instead of hitting a contact form black hole or waiting until Monday.

### Why this matters for Alaska businesses:

You're competing with companies that have call centers and 24/7 support. Your customers don't care that you're a small operation - they just want their questions answered when they're thinking about buying. Every unanswered question is a lost sale to someone who moved on to your competitor.

### What I deliver:

A chat system on your website that knows your business, answers common questions, captures leads, and routes complex issues to you when you're actually available. It's not a generic chatbot - it's trained on your specific services, pricing, and processes.

**Cost: $5k-12k** depending on complexity. Pays for itself if it captures even a few customers who would have gone elsewhere.

If you're tired of losing business because you can't be everywhere at once, let's talk.
